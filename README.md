# Spring Security

### 1. How does Spring Security behave when added to a project without any additional configuration?

**Answer:**

If you add the Spring Security dependency and do nothing else, Spring Boot will automatically apply default security settings, which include:

- ‚úÖ **Basic Authentication:** A login form will be enabled if it's a web application.
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Generated Credentials:** The default username will be user, and a random password will be generated and printed in the logs at startup.
- ‚úÖ **Security Filters Enabled:** Spring Security will automatically protect all endpoints, requiring authentication for any request.
- ‚úÖ **No Custom User Details:** Since no users are configured, it uses the default in-memory user.

**Example:**

If you add this dependency:

```
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

When you start the application, you'll see a log message like:
```
Using generated security password: a1b2c3d4e5f6
```
And when you try to access any endpoint, it will prompt for credentials.

### 2. What happens if I configure a single user with credentials (e.g., foo as both username and password) in application.properties?

**Answer:**

If you explicitly define a user in **application.properties** like this:

```
spring.security.user.name=foo
spring.security.user.password=foo
```

**Spring Boot will:**

- ‚úÖ Override the default user: The auto-generated user will be replaced with foo.
- ‚úÖ Enable Basic Authentication: All endpoints will still be protected, but now require foo as the username and password.
- ‚úÖ No Password Encoding: If foo is stored as plaintext, Spring Security will allow it but may warn about insecure storage.
- ‚úÖ No Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The user will have the default ROLE_USER unless explicitly assigned.

**Example Scenario:**

1. Start the application and access an endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

2. You'll be prompted for credentials.

3. Enter foo as both username and password.

4. You‚Äôll be authenticated and granted access.

### 4. How Does Spring Security Handle Authentication?

**Answer:**

The following image visually represents the authentication process in Spring Security:

![Spring Authentication Flow](src/main/resources/static/spring_security.png)

üìå **Step 1: Client Request ‚Üí Filter Chain**

A user sends a request to access a secured resource.

The request goes through the Filter Chain, where security-related filters intercept and process it.

üìå **Step 2: Authentication Filter ‚Üí Authentication Manager**

The Authentication Filter extracts user credentials (like username and password) and forwards them to the AuthenticationManager.

üìå **Step 3: Authentication Provider ‚Üí UserDetailsService**

The AuthenticationManager delegates authentication to an Authentication Provider (e.g., DaoAuthenticationProvider).

The Authentication Provider then calls UserDetailsService to fetch user details from the Database using findByUsername().

üìå **Step 4: Password Validation ‚Üí Security Context**

The password is verified using PasswordEncoder (e.g., BCrypt).

If authentication is successful, the Security Context stores the authenticated user details.

üìå **Step 5: Access Application Controller ‚Üí Response to Client**

If authentication is successful, the request is processed by the Application Controllers and the response is sent back to the user.

### 5. Let‚Äôs see how we configure security in a Spring Boot application and why it‚Äôs important to learn this.

**Answer:**

In Spring Boot applications, configuring security is essential to protect your endpoints and data from unauthorized access. Spring Security offers a highly customizable way to define how authentication and authorization should be handled.

We use a SecurityFilterChain bean to define these configurations. Here's a simple example:

```
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth.anyRequest().authenticated())
.httpBasic(withDefaults())
.sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS));
return http.build();
}
```

**This code does three important things:**

- Requires authentication for all incoming requests.

- Uses HTTP Basic authentication, which is simple and useful for testing APIs.

- Configures stateless session management, meaning the server doesn't store user sessions‚Äîideal for REST APIs.

**üìå Why is this important?**

Understanding how to configure security ensures:

- Your application is protected from unauthorized access.

- You can choose the right authentication mechanism for your use case.

- You know how to build scalable and secure REST APIs, which are the backbone of modern web apps.

**Now, based on this configuration, here are some follow-up questions you can dive into to understand each part in more detail:**

#### ‚ùì What is SecurityFilterChain, and why do we use it in Spring Security?

**Answer:**

**SecurityFilterChain** is a core interface in Spring Security that defines a chain of filters used to secure HTTP requests.

Prior to Spring Security 5.7, we used to extend **WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter** and override its methods to customize security. However, with recent versions (especially from 6.x), Spring promotes a more functional, component-based approach using beans.

With SecurityFilterChain, you define a @Bean that directly configures security using HttpSecurity.

Why it's important:

- It's declarative and modern ‚Äî aligning with the Spring Boot philosophy of configuration via beans.

- Makes security easier to test, modularize, and customize.

- You can define multiple filter chains for different endpoint patterns (e.g., /admin/**, /api/**).

#### ‚ùì What does .authorizeHttpRequests() do in the configuration?

**Answer:**

**.authorizeHttpRequests()** is a method on the HttpSecurity object that allows you to define authorization rules ‚Äî essentially, who can access what in your application.

You can use it to:

- Allow unrestricted access to public resources (permitAll())

- Require authentication for sensitive resources (authenticated())

- Restrict access based on roles (hasRole("ADMIN"), etc.)

**Example:**

```
http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
.requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
.requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
.anyRequest().authenticated());
```

**This tells Spring:**

- Let anyone access /public/**

- Only allow admins to access /admin/**

- All other requests must be authenticated 

#### ‚ùì Why do we use .httpBasic() and when should we choose .formLogin() instead?

**Answer:**

**.httpBasic()** enables HTTP Basic Authentication, where the client sends a username and password with every request (usually via headers).

It‚Äôs simple and best for tools like Postman or for internal APIs.

Example header:
**Authorization: Basic c2VqYWw6c2VqYWxJc1RoZUJlc3Q=**

**.formLogin()** enables a login form-based authentication for browser-based applications. It redirects unauthenticated users to a login page (/login) and stores session data after successful login.

When to use:

- Use .httpBasic() for APIs or development/testing.

- Use .formLogin() for traditional web applications where a login page is needed.

#### ‚ùì What is the role of SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS, and why is it used here?

**Answer:**

SessionCreationPolicy tells Spring Security how to manage sessions. The STATELESS policy means do not create or use any HTTP session.

**üß† What does "stateless" mean?**

In a stateless application, each HTTP request is treated independently ‚Äî the server doesn't store any information about previous requests (no session, no memory of who you are).

**What happens when you set SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS?**

- No HTTP session is created by Spring Security.

- No JSESSIONID cookie is sent or expected.

- The application does not remember the user between requests.

- You must send authentication credentials (or token) with every request.

**Example Use Case:**

This is ideal for REST APIs, where each request should be self-contained:

```
http
.sessionManagement(session ->
session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS));
```

**This tells Spring:**

‚ÄúDon't save any login session. Every request must come with its own authentication (like a token or basic auth header).‚Äù

**‚ùå Without STATELESS:**

- Spring would create a session after login and store the user's authentication in it.

- Future requests wouldn't need credentials again, just the session cookie.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:**

- Stateless apps are more scalable (no session memory on server).

- But you must handle auth differently ‚Äî usually with JWT tokens or passing credentials every time.

**Summary:**

| With STATELESS |	Without STATELESS|
|----------------| ------------------|
|No session stored|	Session created (JSESSIONID)|
|Send credentials every time|	Login once, then use session |
|Perfect for REST APIs |	Better for web apps|

Other Session Policies:

- **ALWAYS:** Always create an HTTP session

- **NEVER:** Don‚Äôt create but use if exists

- **IF_REQUIRED:** Default, creates a session if needed

Using STATELESS makes your app more secure, predictable, and scalable.

### 6. How do we configure in-memory users in Spring Security, and why is it important?
Answer:
In Spring Security, we can configure in-memory users using the UserDetailsService bean with InMemoryUserDetailsManager. This allows us to define a list of users, their passwords, and their roles directly in the code, without connecting to a database.

For example:

```
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    UserDetails user1 = User.withUsername("user1")
                            .password("{noop}password1")
                            .roles("USER")
                            .build();

    UserDetails user2 = User.withUsername("user2")
                            .password("{noop}password2")
                            .roles("ADMIN")
                            .build();

    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user1, user2);
}
```

**This is especially useful for:**

- Quickly setting up authentication during development or testing

- Demonstrating role-based access control without complex setup

**However, it‚Äôs important to note:**

- The {noop} prefix disables password encoding (not recommended for production).

- In-memory storage is not persistent ‚Äî users reset when the app restarts.

- For production, users should be stored securely in a database and passwords should be properly encoded using a PasswordEncoder.

### 7. How can we implement role-based access control at the method level in Spring Security?

**Answer:**

We can enforce role-based access control at the method level using annotations like **@PreAuthorize**, along with **@EnableMethodSecurity** in the configuration class. This is known as **method-level security**, and it allows you to secure individual controller methods based on user roles.

**‚úÖ Step-by-step setup:**

1. Enable Method Security

Add this annotation in your security configuration:
    ```
    @EnableMethodSecurity
    ```

This enables annotations like @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize, etc.

2. Add Role-based Restrictions using @PreAuthorize:

    ```
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
    @GetMapping("/user")
    public String userEndpoint() {
        return "<h1>Hello, User!</h1>";
    }
   
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    @GetMapping("/admin")
    public String adminEndpoint() {
        return "<h1>Hello, Admin!</h1>";
    }
   ```

**How it works:**

- When a user accesses **/user**, Spring checks if the authenticated user has the role **USER**.

- Similarly, for **/admin**, the user must have the role **ADMIN**.

- If the condition fails, Spring returns a 403 Forbidden.

**Note:**

- Make sure your users have roles defined correctly in your UserDetailsService.

**Example user setup:**

```
    UserDetails user = User.withUsername("user1")
    .password("{noop}pass")
    .roles("USER") // automatically becomes ROLE_USER
    .build();
```

## H2 Database

### 8. What is the H2 database, and why do we use it in Spring Boot projects?

**Answer:**

H2 is an in-memory, lightweight, fast relational database that is easy to embed into Java applications.

**We use it during development and testing because:**

- It doesn‚Äôt require external setup or installation.

- It resets automatically on each application restart.

- It helps simulate real database behavior without needing a full DB engine like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

#### ‚ùì How do we enable and secure the H2 console in a Spring Boot application?

**Answer:**

To enable and view the H2 console in a Spring Boot app, especially when security is enabled, you need to follow these key steps:

**1. Add Dependencies**

You added the following in pom.xml:

```
<!-- JPA for database operations -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- H2 in-memory database -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

‚úÖ This sets up Spring Data JPA and the H2 database which runs in-memory.

 **2. Configure application.properties**

```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test
```

‚úÖ This enables the H2 web console and configures the database to use an in-memory data source.

**3. Allow Access in Security Config**

You did this in your SecurityFilterChain:

```
http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth ->
auth.requestMatchers("/h2-console/**").permitAll()
.anyRequest().authenticated())
.sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))
.httpBasic(withDefaults());
```

‚úÖ This makes /h2-console/** accessible without authentication, while securing other endpoints.

**4. Handle CSRF and Frame Options**

`What is CSRF?`

**CSRF** stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery.
It's an attack where a malicious website tricks a user (who is already authenticated) into making unintended requests to your app ‚Äî with their valid credentials.

Spring Security enables CSRF protection by default for stateful applications, especially those using cookies for session tracking (like form-based login apps).

`Why are we disabling CSRF here?`

- The H2 console is a web-based tool that internally uses HTML forms to send data (like queries or settings).

- CSRF protection blocks these form submissions because they don't include a CSRF token.

- But the H2 console doesn't support CSRF tokens.

‚úÖ So during development, we disable CSRF protection using:

```
http.csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable());
```

`What are frame options?`

Spring Security sets the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header to DENY by default.
This is a security feature to protect your app from **clickjacking** attacks.

| **Clickjacking** is when a malicious site loads your app in an invisible `<iframe>` and tricks users into clicking buttons that perform unintended actions. |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

`What does sameOrigin do?`

The H2 console is rendered in an `<iframe>` ‚Äî which won‚Äôt load if Spring Security blocks it due to frame options.

```
http.headers(header -> header.frameOptions(frameOptions -> frameOptions.sameOrigin()));
```

This tells Spring Security:

     "Allow pages to be embedded in <iframe>s only if the request comes from the same origin (i.e., same domain and port)."

‚úÖ **This is a safe middle ground for development** ‚Äî H2 console loads fine, and you're still protected from external domains trying to embed your app.

#### ‚ùì What should be avoided when using the H2 console in production?

**Answer:**

- Do not use `.csrf().disable()` in production.

- Do not expose `/h2-console/**` endpoints in a live environment.

- The H2 database itself is not meant for production use ‚Äî always replace it with a persistent database.

## JDBC Authentication

### 9. What is JDBC Authentication in Spring Security?
Detailed Explanation:

JDBC Authentication is a mechanism where Spring Security authenticates users by querying a relational database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). Instead of using hardcoded users like in-memory authentication, it fetches the username, password, and roles directly from database tables (usually named users and authorities).

‚úÖ Why it‚Äôs useful:

- Your application can manage users dynamically.

- Credentials are persisted, not lost on app restart.

- It scales well for real-world applications. 

#### ‚ùì Why do we prefer JDBC Authentication over In-Memory Authentication?

In-memory authentication stores credentials in code like:

```
User.withUsername("admin").password("{noop}pass").roles("ADMIN").build()
```

**This:**
    
- ‚úÖ Works well for demos or tests

- ‚ùå Doesn't scale

- ‚ùå Loses users on restart

- ‚ùå Isn't secure for production

**JDBC Authentication:**

- ‚úÖ Stores users in a database (e.g., H2, MySQL)

- ‚úÖ Allows changes without modifying code

- ‚úÖ Supports secure hashing, role updates, etc.

#### ‚ùì How do we enable JDBC Authentication in Spring Boot?

**Detailed Steps:**

1. First, we inject a DataSource bean:

```
@Autowired
DataSource dataSource;
```

2. Then return a JdbcUserDetailsManager in your security config:

```
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    JdbcUserDetailsManager manager = new JdbcUserDetailsManager(dataSource);
    manager.createUser(...); // Optional user creation
    return manager;
}
```
Spring will now use this manager to:

- Query the users and authorities tables.

- Authenticate users using credentials stored in DB.

#### ‚ùì Why did we get a bad SQL grammar error when using createUser()?

When we used manager.createUser(...), Spring tried to execute this SQL behind the scenes:

```
INSERT INTO users (username, password, enabled) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
```

But if the `users` table doesn't exist yet in the database, you'll get:

    PreparedStatementCallback; bad SQL grammar

This is Spring's way of saying:

    ‚ÄúI expected a table named users, but I couldn't find it!‚Äù

#### ‚ùì How did we fix the table not found / bad SQL grammar issue?

We created a file named schema.sql in the src/main/resources folder and added the required table definitions:

```
create table users(
    username varchar_ignorecase(50) not null primary key,
    password varchar_ignorecase(500) not null,
    enabled boolean not null
);

create table authorities (
    username varchar_ignorecase(50) not null,
    authority varchar_ignorecase(50) not null,
    constraint fk_authorities_users foreign key(username) references users(username)
);

create unique index ix_auth_username on authorities (username, authority);

```


Spring Boot automatically detects this file and runs it when the app starts (if auto-initialization is enabled).

#### ‚ùì Where did we get the schema definition from?

Spring Security provides a default schema for JDBC Authentication. We fetched it directly from their GitHub:

[üìé users.ddl - Spring Security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/main/core/src/main/resources/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/jdbc/users.ddl)

It ensures Spring can manage users with the expected structure.

## JWT Authentication

### 10. What is JWT and why do we use it?

**Answer:** 

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties.

**üîë Why use JWT?**

- It enables stateless authentication.

- The token contains all necessary user data (like username, roles), so the server doesn‚Äôt need to store session state.

- Commonly used in REST APIs where traditional session management (like JSESSIONID) doesn't scale.

### 11. How does the JWT Authentication flow work?

**Answer:**

**Here‚Äôs the full flow üîÅ:**

![JWT Authentication Flow](src/main/resources/static/jwt_authentication.png)

1. User logs in ‚Üí sends username & password.

2. Server authenticates and generates a JWT signed with a secret key.

3. JWT is returned to the client.

4. Client stores it (usually in localStorage or sessionStorage).

5. For future requests, client sends the JWT in the Authorization header:

   `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

6. Server verifies the JWT, extracts user info, and grants access.

### 12. What are the responsibilities of key components like `JwtUtils`, `AuthEntryPointJwt`, and `AuthTokenFilter`?

**Answer:**

`JwtUtils`

- Responsible for creating, validating, and parsing JWT tokens.

- Uses a secret key to sign the token.

- Extracts username and checks expiration during validation.

`AuthEntryPointJwt`

- Handles unauthorized access attempts.

- Sends a 401 Unauthorized response when token is missing or invalid.

- Acts as a gatekeeper when the user is not authenticated.

`AuthTokenFilter`

- A request filter that runs before each secured request.

- Extracts the token from the Authorization header.

- Validates the token using JwtUtils and sets the authentication context if valid.
